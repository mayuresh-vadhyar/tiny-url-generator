URL Shortener Service

Design a server capable of generating, tracking and managing shortened URLs with
specific functionalities. The server should offer various endpoints for interaction:

e An endpoint to generate the shortened URL. This endpoint should account for the
following:

o Custom aliases (custom URLs suggested by the user).

o Generate an optimal unique alias if not provided by the user. If the same URL is
passed for shortening again, ensure that a new shortened URL is generated
every time.

o TTL (Time to live): Each alias will have a TTL. The duration for which can be
specified by the user. If not specified, the default TTL should be of 120 seconds.

e An endpoint which redirects the user to the long url based on the alias provided.

An endpoint to get the analytics of an active alias. This endpoint will return basic
information about the shortened URLs such as the number of visits and the last 10
access times. For better understanding, check the example in the API specification.

e An endpoint to update the Custom alias, TTL of the specified existing shortened URL.
When an alias is updated using Custom alias, the analytics data of the old alias should
be deleted.

e An endpoint to delete the specified existing shortened URL

Apart from the above endpoints, the mapping for the shortened URLs must be deleted from the
datastore once the TTL duration has passed.

Constraints

Ensure quick redirections with low latency.

Don’t use any databases. Implement the solution with in-memory variables.

The complexity of endpoint requests should be aimed at O(log n) or O(1) for scalability
and efficiency.
